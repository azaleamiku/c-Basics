# C++ Basics

This repository contains a collection of fundamental C++ programs and code snippets, designed for learning and practicing core concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific idea, from basic syntax to functions and control flow.

## Current Topics

### Basic Syntax and I/O
* **helloWorld.cpp**: A classic "Hello, World!" program.
* **syntax.cpp**: Demonstrates basic C++ syntax and structure.
* **input.cpp**: Shows how to take and handle user input.
* **inputBoxes.cpp**: An example of inputting multiple values.

### Control Flow
* **ifElse.cpp**: Demonstrates simple conditional logic with if/else statements.
* **oddEven.cpp**: An example of checking if a number is odd or even.
* **secretNumber.cpp**: A basic game using conditional logic.

### Loops and Arrays
* **arrayLoop.cpp**: Shows how to iterate through an array using a loop.
* **arraySum.cpp**: Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.
* **arrayList.cpp**: An example of using a dynamic array (vector).
* **fillList.cpp**: Demonstrates how to populate a list with data.

### Functions and Structs
* **listFunction.cpp**: An example of a function that works with lists.
* **returnListfunction.cpp**: Shows a function that returns a list.
* **parameter.cpp**: Demonstrates how to pass parameters to a function.
* **boxStruct.cpp**: An example of using a basic C++ `struct`.

### Problem-Solving Examples
* **calc.cpp**: A simple calculator program.
* **circumference.cpp**: Calculates the circumference of a circle.
* **factorial.cpp**: Computes the factorial of a number.
* **numbersSum.cpp**: Calculates the sum of a series of numbers.
* **primeNumberchecker.cpp**: Determines if a number is prime.
* **rectangleArea.cpp**: Calculates the area of a rectangle.

## Planned Additions

I plan to add more examples for more advanced topics, including:
* Classes and Objects (OOP)
* Pointers
* File I/O
* Recursion
